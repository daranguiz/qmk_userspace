# Tasks: QMK Keymap Refactoring & Modularization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-keymap-refactor/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/file-structure.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included per feature specification. Manual compilation and firmware flashing tests only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Reference Implementation**: Lulu (`keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c`) and Skeletyl (`keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/daranguiz_miryoku/keymap.c`) have been confirmed to use **identical 3x5+3 layouts** across all 8 layers (BASE, NAV, MOUSE, MEDIA, NUM, SYM, FUN, BUTTON). This confirmed keymap will be extracted as the shared base layout in `users/dario/layers.h`.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and userspace structure creation

**Note**: This phase creates the foundational userspace directory that will hold all shared keymap code.

- [X] T001 Create userspace directory structure at users/dario/
- [X] T002 Create placeholder users/dario/dario.h with layer enums (BASE, NAV, MOUSE, MEDIA, NUM, SYM, FUN, BUTTON)
- [X] T003 [P] Create placeholder users/dario/dario.c with empty process_record_user function
- [X] T004 [P] Create users/dario/rules.mk with shared feature flags (MOUSEKEY_ENABLE, EXTRAKEY_ENABLE)
- [X] T005 [P] Create scripts/generate_keymap_diagram.sh for visualization automation
- [X] T006 [P] Create docs/keymaps/ directory for generated visualizations

**Checkpoint**: Userspace structure ready for shared code implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core shared keymap infrastructure that ALL keyboards will depend on

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No keyboard migration can begin until this phase is complete

**Reference Source**: Extract layer definitions from `keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c` lines 6-54 (confirmed identical to Skeletyl)

- [X] T008 Define all custom keycodes in users/dario/dario.h (U_NA, U_NU, U_UND, U_CUT, U_CPY, U_PST, U_RDO, MS_*, RM_*)
- [X] T009 Implement custom keycode handlers in users/dario/dario.c (process_record_user with switch cases for U_UND, U_CUT, U_CPY, U_PST, U_RDO if needed)
- [X] T010 Update users/dario/rules.mk to add dario.c to SRC
- [X] T011 Extract LAYER_BASE from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 7-10) into users/dario/layers.h as LAYER_BASE macro with 36 keycodes
- [X] T012 Extract LAYER_NAV from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 13-16) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T013 [P] Extract LAYER_MOUSE from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 19-22) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T014 [P] Extract LAYER_MEDIA from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 25-28) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T015 [P] Extract LAYER_NUM from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 31-34) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T016 [P] Extract LAYER_SYM from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 37-40) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T017 [P] Extract LAYER_FUN from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 43-46) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T018 [P] Extract LAYER_BUTTON from keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c (lines 49-52) into users/dario/layers.h
- [X] T019 Add header guards and includes to users/dario/layers.h (#ifndef USERSPACE_LAYERS_H, #include "dario.h")
- [X] T020 Compile test build with any existing keyboard to verify userspace compiles successfully

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all 8 layers extracted from confirmed identical keymap - keyboard migration can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 5 - Consistent Naming Convention (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Standardize all custom keymap directories to use exactly "dario" as the keymap name

**Independent Test**: Search codebase for keymap directories, verify all use "dario", confirm build commands work with :dario

**Why US5 First**: This cleanup must happen before US1 and US4 to ensure we're working with consistently named directories. US5 has no dependencies on the modular system.

- [X] T030 [P] [US5] Create build_skeletyl.sh in repository root with correct keyboard path
- [X] T031 [P] [US5] Verify build_lulu.sh exists and uses correct path

### Documentation Updates

- [X] T032 [US5] Update KEYBOARDS.md to reflect all keymaps using "dario" naming
- [X] T033 [US5] Update LULU_FLASHING_GUIDE.md if it references keymap names
- [X] T034 [US5] Search for any other documentation files referencing old keymap names and update

**Checkpoint**: All keymaps consistently named "dario", all build commands use :dario

---

## Phase 4: User Story 4 - Code Cleanup (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Remove all legacy experimental code, dead code, and redundant configurations

**Independent Test**: Review codebase for commented-out code, unused flags, old experiment references - verify none exist

**Why US4 Before US1**: Clean code is essential before implementing the modular system to avoid bugs from dead code and to have clear starting point.

- [X] T046 [US4] Remove any references to bilateral combinations patch in Skeletyl keymap (none found)

### Userspace Cleanup (if exists)

- [X] T047 [US4] Review users/daranguiz/ directory if it exists and identify code to migrate or remove (does not exist)
- [X] T048 [US4] Remove any legacy userspace directories that won't be used (none found)

### Verification

- [X] T049 [US4] Compile all three keyboards to verify they still build after cleanup
- [X] T050 [US4] Document all currently-used features in a checklist for reference (documented in rules.mk files)

**Checkpoint**: Clean codebase with no dead code, only actively used configuration

---

## Phase 4.5: External Userspace Migration (Blocking Prerequisite)

**Goal**: Migrate existing keymaps and userspace to QMK External Userspace to enable proper userspace functionality

**Why This Phase**: QMK 0.30.6 has deprecated in-tree userspace (users/ directory). The build system generates absolute paths (/users/dario) instead of relative paths (users/dario), breaking userspace includes. External Userspace is the official supported solution.

**Prerequisites**: User must fork https://github.com/qmk/qmk_userspace and clone it locally before starting this phase.

**Reference**: https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_external_userspace

**Scope**: This phase ONLY migrates existing code as-is. Refactoring (layer macros, wrappers) happens in Phase 5.

### External Userspace Setup (User Manual Steps)

- [X] T051A [Phase4.5] User: Fork https://github.com/qmk/qmk_userspace to personal GitHub account
- [X] T051B [Phase4.5] User: Clone forked qmk_userspace repository to $HOME/qmk_userspace
- [X] T051C [Phase4.5] User: Run `qmk config user.overlay_dir="$(realpath ~/qmk_userspace)"` to configure QMK CLI
- [X] T051D [Phase4.5] User: Verify configuration with `qmk config user.overlay_dir`

### Migration: Copy Userspace AS-IS

- [X] T052 [Phase4.5] Copy entire users/dario/ directory to ~/qmk_userspace/users/dario/ (all files unchanged)

- [X] T054 [Phase4.5] Verify ~/qmk_userspace/users/dario/dario.c exists
- [X] T055 [Phase4.5] Verify ~/qmk_userspace/users/dario/config.h exists
- [X] T056 [Phase4.5] Verify ~/qmk_userspace/users/dario/rules.mk exists

### Migration: Copy Keymaps AS-IS

- [X] T057 [P] [Phase4.5] Copy entire keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/dario/ to ~/qmk_userspace/keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/dario/ (unchanged)
- [X] T058 [P] [Phase4.5] Copy entire keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/ to ~/qmk_userspace/keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/ (unchanged)
- [X] T059 [P] [Phase4.5] Copy entire keyboards/lily58/keymaps/dario/ to ~/qmk_userspace/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/dario/ (unchanged)

### Register Build Targets in qmk.json

- [X] T060 [Phase4.5] Run `qmk userspace-add -kb bastardkb/skeletyl/promicro -km dario` to register Skeletyl

- [X] T065 [Phase4.5] Test build Lulu: `qmk compile -kb boardsource/lulu/rp2040 -km dario`
- [X] T066 [Phase4.5] Test build Lily58: `qmk compile -kb lily58/rev1 -km dario`
- [X] T067 [Phase4.5] Verify all three builds succeed with existing keymap code

### Test Batch Compilation

- [X] T068 [Phase4.5] Run `qmk userspace-compile` to build all registered keyboards at once
- [X] T069 [Phase4.5] Verify firmware files created in ~/qmk_userspace/ root directory for all three keyboards

### Commit External Userspace

- [X] T070 [Phase4.5] Commit all changes to ~/qmk_userspace/ repository
- [X] T071 [Phase4.5] Push to personal qmk_userspace fork on GitHub

**Checkpoint**: External Userspace working - all three keyboards build successfully from external userspace with existing keymaps

**Next Phase**: Phase 5 will implement the modular layer system (LAYER_* macros, wrappers) on top of this working external userspace.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 1 - Modular Base Layout Management (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Establish single source of truth for core 3x5+3 layout shared across all keyboards

**Independent Test**: Modify LAYER_BASE in users/dario/layers.h once, compile all keyboards, verify identical base layer behavior

**Why US1 After US4/US5**: This is the foundational modular system that requires clean, consistently-named keymaps.

- [X] T072 [US1] Rebuild all three keyboards and verify the change appears in all builds
- [X] T073 [US1] Revert the test change in users/dario/layers.h

**Checkpoint**: Single source of truth established - modifying users/dario/layers.h affects all keyboards

---

## Phase 6: User Story 2 - Keyboard-Specific Customization (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable hardware-specific features (OLED, extra keys, encoders) per keyboard while keeping base layout shared

**Independent Test**: Configure OLED for Lulu without affecting other keyboards, verify base layer remains identical while OLED functions correctly

**Why US2 After US1**: This builds on the modular base by adding hardware differentiation.

- Skeletyl, Lulu, Lily58 migrations can run sequentially or in parallel
- Each keyboard: wrapper macro → keymap.c rewrite → rules.mk → build test → flash test (sequential)
- Final verification after all keyboards migrated

**User Story 2 (Hardware Features)**:
- Lulu OLED and Lily58 OLED implementations can run in parallel
- Extra keys documentation can run in parallel
- Verification after implementations complete

**User Story 3 (Visualization)**:
- Config setup tasks can run in parallel with script updates
- Diagram generation for three keyboards can run in parallel
- ASCII art for three README files can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T003, T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: T013-T018 (all layer definitions except BASE and NAV) can run in parallel after T011-T012
- **Phase 3 (US5)**: T021-T023 (Lily58), T024-T026 (Skeletyl), T027-T028 (Lulu) can run in parallel; T029-T031 (build scripts) can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US4)**: T035-T038 (Lulu), T039-T042 (Lily58), T043-T046 (Skeletyl), T047-T048 (userspace) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US1)**: Skeletyl migration (T051-T056), Lulu migration (T057-T063), Lily58 migration (T064-T070) can run in parallel AFTER each completes wrapper macro step
- **Phase 6 (US2)**: T074-T080 (Lulu OLED), T081-T087 (Lily58 OLED), T088-T090 (extra keys docs) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7 (US3)**: T094-T098 (config), T104-T106 (diagram generation), T109-T111 (ASCII art) can run in parallel within their groups
- **Phase 8**: T115-T120 (documentation tasks) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Modular Base Layout)

```bash
# After Foundational Phase 2 completes, launch all three keyboard migrations in parallel:

# Terminal 1: Skeletyl migration
Task: "Create keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/dario/keymap_config.h"
Task: "Rewrite keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/dario/keymap.c to include dario.h and layers.h"
Task: "Test build: make bastardkb/skeletyl:dario"

# Terminal 2: Lulu migration
Task: "Create keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap_config.h with wrapper macro"
Task: "Rewrite keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c to include keymap_config.h, dario.h, and layers.h"
Task: "Test build: make boardsource/lulu/rp2040:dario"

# Terminal 3: Lily58 migration
Task: "Create keyboards/lily58/keymaps/dario/keymap_config.h with wrapper macro"
Task: "Rewrite keyboards/lily58/keymaps/dario/keymap.c to include keymap_config.h, dario.h, and layers.h"
Task: "Test build: make lily58/rev1:dario"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 5 + 4 + 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories, extracts confirmed identical layers)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 5 (Naming)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 4 (Cleanup)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 1 (Modular Base Layout)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that modifying users/dario/layers.h updates all keyboards
7. Deploy/use firmware if ready

This gives you the core value: single source of truth for layout across all keyboards.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (8 layers extracted from confirmed identical keymaps)
2. Add User Story 5 → Naming consistent
3. Add User Story 4 → Code clean
4. Add User Story 1 → Modular system working (MVP!)
5. Add User Story 2 → Hardware features customizable
6. Add User Story 3 → Visual documentation available
7. Polish → Production ready

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Sequential Implementation Strategy (Recommended)

Given this is a solo project with embedded firmware (less parallelizable than web services):

1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup and Foundational (required, extracts 8 layers)
2. **Phase 3**: US5 Naming (all keyboards sequentially)
3. **Phase 4**: US4 Cleanup (all keyboards sequentially)
4. **Phase 5**: US1 Modular Base (Skeletyl → Lulu → Lily58 sequentially, test each)
5. **Phase 6**: US2 Hardware Features (Lulu OLED → Lily58 OLED)
6. **Phase 7**: US3 Visualization (config → scripts → generation → ASCII art)
7. **Phase 8**: Polish and validation

## Notes

- **Reference keymap**: keyboards/boardsource/lulu/keymaps/dario/keymap.c and keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/daranguiz_miryoku/keymap.c confirmed identical across all 8 layers
- All 8 layers extracted in Phase 2: BASE, NAV, MOUSE, MEDIA, NUM, SYM, FUN, BUTTON
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Build and flash firmware after each keyboard migration to catch issues early
- Commit after each keyboard is fully migrated and tested
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution Principle V requires ASCII art in README.md files
- Constitution Principle I ensures all changes stay in keyboards/*/keymaps/dario/ or users/dario/
- Performance goal: compilation time within 10% of baseline
- Success criteria: 40% code reduction through deduplication

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 127 tasks across 8 phases

**Task Count by User Story**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 7 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 13 tasks (extracts all 8 confirmed identical layers)
- Phase 3 (US5 - Naming): 14 tasks
- Phase 4 (US4 - Cleanup): 16 tasks
- Phase 5 (US1 - Modular Base): 23 tasks
- Phase 6 (US2 - Hardware Customization): 20 tasks
- Phase 7 (US3 - Visualization): 21 tasks
- Phase 8 (Polish): 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- 34 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with others in their phase
- 3 keyboards can be migrated in parallel (if multiple developers)
- Layer definitions (Phase 2) can be parallelized (6 of 8 layers)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US5: Search for "dario" keymap directories, verify build commands work
- US4: Search for commented code, verify none exists
- US1: Modify users/dario/layers.h once, verify all keyboards affected
- US2: Configure OLED on one keyboard, verify others unaffected
- US3: Generate SVG, verify accuracy and printability

**Suggested MVP Scope**:
- Phase 1: Setup (7 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (13 tasks) - **Extracts confirmed identical layers**
- Phase 3: US5 Naming (14 tasks)
- Phase 4: US4 Cleanup (16 tasks)
- Phase 5: US1 Modular Base (23 tasks)
- **Total MVP**: 73 tasks

After MVP, you have a working modular keymap system with single source of truth based on the confirmed identical Lulu/Skeletyl layouts. US2 (hardware features) and US3 (visualization) are valuable but not critical for core functionality.

**Format Validation**: ✅ All 127 tasks follow strict checklist format:
- Checkbox: `- [ ]`
- Task ID: T001-T127 sequential
- [P] marker: 34 tasks marked as parallelizable
- [Story] label: 94 tasks have user story labels (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Description: All include clear actions with file paths

**Key Update**: Phase 2 (Foundational) now explicitly references extracting layers from the confirmed identical Lulu/Skeletyl keymaps as validated by the user.
