# Tasks: Unified QMK/ZMK Keymap Configuration with Code Generation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-unified-keymap-codegen/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in spec - tasks focus on implementation and integration testing (compilation verification)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Repository root: `/Users/dario/git/qmk_userspace/`
- Unified config: `config/`
- QMK output: `qmk/keymaps/`, QMK config: `qmk/config/`
- ZMK output: `zmk/keymaps/`, ZMK config: `zmk/config/`
- Scripts: `scripts/`
- Tests: `tests/`

---

---

- [X] T015 Implement LayerCompiler.compile_layer() in scripts/layer_compiler.py (apply extensions + translate)
- [X] T016 [P] Implement LayerCompiler.get_extension_keys() in scripts/layer_compiler.py
- [X] T017 Implement ConfigValidator.validate_keymap_config() in scripts/validator.py (schema + business logic)
- [X] T018 [P] Implement ConfigValidator.validate_board_config() in scripts/validator.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Single-Source Keymap Updates (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Update keymap in one place (config/keymap.yaml) and generate both QMK and ZMK keymaps automatically

**Independent Test**: Modify a key binding in config/keymap.yaml, run generation, verify both QMK and ZMK keymaps reflect the change and compile successfully

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T032 [US1] Integration test: compile generated QMK keymap with qmk compile -kb bastardkb/skeletyl/promicro -km dario
- [X] T032a [US1] Update users/dario/dario.h to export layer enums for generated keymaps
- [X] T032b [US1] Update QMKGenerator to include "dario.h" and use shared layer enums instead of generating inline

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - single YAML config generates working QMK keymap for 36-key board with proper userspace integration

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Firmware-Specific Feature Handling (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Define superset keymap with both QMK-specific and ZMK-specific keybindings, automatically filtered during generation

- [ ] T044 [US2] Test bootloader key consistency: verify QK_BOOT in QMK and &bootloader in ZMK

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - superset keymap generates firmware-specific outputs with proper filtering

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Board-Specific Layout Extensions (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Define board-specific extensions in unified config, generate keymaps with extra keys for larger boards while maintaining core consistency

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Repository Migration (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Migrate current QMK userspace repo to unified monorepo structure with config/, qmk/, zmk/, and unified CI/CD

- [ ] T072 [US4] Test CI/CD: push to branch and verify GitHub Actions builds all firmware binaries

**Checkpoint**: Repository is fully migrated to monorepo structure, all builds work locally and in CI/CD

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Easy Board Addition (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Add new keyboards quickly with minimal configuration via helper script

**Independent Test**: Run add_board.sh with board details, verify boards.yaml is updated and keymap generation works

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **US1 (Phase 3)**: Can start after Phase 2 ✅ MVP - highest priority
  - **US4 (Phase 6)**: Can start after Phase 2 (migration) - P1 priority, recommended to do early
  - **US2 (Phase 4)**: Can start after Phase 2 and US1 completion (builds on QMK generator)
  - **US3 (Phase 5)**: Can start after Phase 2 and US1 completion (extends generator)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch config files together:
Task: T019 [P] [US1] "Create initial config/keymap.yaml"
Task: T020 [P] [US1] "Create initial config/boards.yaml"

# Launch FileSystemWriter methods together:
Task: T024 [US1] "Implement FileSystemWriter.write_file()"
Task: T025 [P] [US1] "Implement FileSystemWriter.ensure_directory()"
Task: T026 [P] [US1] "Implement FileSystemWriter.write_all()"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 4)

**Recommended Approach**: US1 first (prove generator works), then US4 (migrate repo structure)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T018) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T032) - Core generator for 36-key QMK boards
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently (modify YAML, generate, compile)
5. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (T059-T072) - Migrate to monorepo structure
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test migration (verify all builds work, CI/CD passes)
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: Single YAML config generates working QMK keymaps, repository migrated to unified structure

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → QMK generation works ✅
3. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Monorepo migration complete ✅
4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Firmware filtering works (ZMK + Bluetooth)
5. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Extensions work (42-key, 58-key boards)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Add board tooling works
7. Add Visual Documentation (Phase 8) → SVG/PNG diagrams generated
8. Polish (Phase 9) → Tests, docs, validation, cleanup
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T018)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T019-T032) - Core generator
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (T059-T072) - Migration (can start in parallel!)
3. After US1 completes:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T033-T044) - ZMK support
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (T045-T058) - Extensions
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (T073-T080) - Add board tooling
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Integration tests (compilation verification) ensure generated keymaps are valid
- No explicit unit tests requested in spec - focus on integration testing
- Visual documentation (Phase 8) is MANDATORY per FR-023, FR-024, FR-025, FR-026
- Firmware-specific settings (OLED, RGB, etc.) stay in qmk/config/ and zmk/config/ per FR-027, FR-028
