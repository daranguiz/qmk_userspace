# Implementation Plan: Unified QMK/ZMK Keymap Configuration with Code Generation

**Branch**: `003-unified-keymap-codegen` | **Date**: 2025-11-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-unified-keymap-codegen/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a unified keymap configuration system that maintains a single source of truth (YAML format) for keyboard layouts and automatically generates both QMK and ZMK firmware keymaps. The system uses a monorepo structure with `config/` (unified YAML keymap), `qmk/` (generated QMK keymaps + firmware settings), and `zmk/` (generated ZMK keymaps + firmware settings). The core 36-key (3x5_3) layout is consistent across all keyboards, with support for per-layer optional extensions for larger boards (38-key, 42-key, 58-key). Firmware-specific features are bidirectionally filtered during generation, with simple keycodes silently dropped and complex keybindings strictly validated.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (decision: Python over Bash per user direction)
**Primary Dependencies**: PyYAML 6.0.3 (already installed), pytest (recommended addition for testing)
**Storage**: File-based (YAML configuration files, generated C/header files for QMK, devicetree/keymap files for ZMK)
**Testing**: unittest (stdlib) for core tests, pytest for advanced testing, integration tests verify compilation of generated keymaps
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux development environment (code generator runs locally, output targets QMK/ZMK firmware build systems)
**Project Type**: Code generation tool (CLI script)
**Performance Goals**: Generate all keymaps (5+ keyboards, 8 layers each) in <5 seconds; minimal enough to run on every save
**Constraints**:
  - Generated keymaps must compile without errors on QMK and ZMK build systems 100% of time
  - Generator must be idempotent (reproducible output)
  - Must integrate with existing build scripts (build_all.sh, GitHub Actions)
  - Zero manual edits to generated files (all customization via config/)
**Scale/Scope**:
  - 5-10 physical keyboards with varying sizes (36-key to 58-key)
  - 8+ layers per keyboard (BASE, NAV, MOUSE, MEDIA, NUM, SYM, FUN, BUTTON, plus gaming layers)
  - 200-400 total keybindings managed centrally
  - Single-user personal project (no multi-user considerations)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Upstream Modularity
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Analysis**: This feature enhances upstream modularity by introducing a code generation layer that keeps personal customizations (YAML config files) completely separate from generated QMK keymaps. The generated keymaps will still reside in `keyboards/<keyboard>/keymaps/dario/`, maintaining existing isolation patterns. The monorepo structure adds `config/`, `qmk/`, and `zmk/` directories at the repository root, which do not conflict with upstream QMK code.

**Implementation Impact**:
- YAML configs in `config/` are completely isolated from upstream
- Generated keymaps remain in standard `keyboards/.../keymaps/dario/` locations
- Code generator scripts in `scripts/` are personal tools (allowed per constitution)
- No modifications to upstream quantum/ code or build system

### Principle II: Core 36-Key Layout Consistency
**Status**: ✅ PASS (ENHANCED)

**Analysis**: This feature directly enforces and strengthens Principle II by making it architecturally impossible to have inconsistent core layouts. The unified YAML configuration ensures that the 36-key layout is defined once and propagated identically to all keyboards during generation. This is a significant improvement over manual synchronization.

**Implementation Impact**:
- Single source of truth for `LAYOUT_split_3x5_3` defined in `config/keymap.yaml`
- Generator ensures identical layer definitions across all keyboards
- Home row mod positioning consistency enforced by templating
- Manual duplication errors eliminated by design

### Principle III: Extension Modularity for Larger Keyboards
**Status**: ✅ PASS (ENHANCED)

**Analysis**: The per-layer extension system (3x5_3_pinky, 3x6_3, board-specific overrides) directly implements this principle with better tooling. The YAML schema explicitly separates core layout from extensions, making the architecture self-documenting.

**Implementation Impact**:
- Extensions defined per-layer in `config/keymap.yaml` under `extensions:` key
- Core 36-key layout preserved during extension generation
- Gaming layers and number row support maintained for larger keyboards
- Extension selection managed via `config/boards.yaml` inventory

### Principle IV: Keyboard Inventory Transparency
**Status**: ✅ PASS (ENHANCED)

**Analysis**: The `config/boards.yaml` file becomes the new source of truth for keyboard inventory, replacing the need for manual `KEYBOARDS.md`. This file will list all keyboards with their firmware types, extension requirements, and build configurations.

**Implementation Impact**:
- `config/boards.yaml` provides machine-readable inventory
- Could auto-generate `KEYBOARDS.md` from `boards.yaml` for human consumption
- Adding a new keyboard requires updating `boards.yaml` (enforced by generator)

**QUESTION FOR USER**: Should we auto-generate `KEYBOARDS.md` from `boards.yaml`, or maintain both files manually?

### Principle V: Visual Keymap Documentation
**Status**: ✅ PASS (MANDATORY - IN SCOPE)

**Analysis**: Visual documentation (SVG/PNG images) is mandatory per constitution and is now explicitly required in the spec (FR-023, FR-024, FR-025, FR-026). Visualization MUST be integrated into the code generation workflow.

**Implementation Impact**:
- Visual diagrams (SVG/PNG) MUST be generated automatically after keymap generation (FR-024)
- Visual diagrams MUST be placed in `docs/keymaps/` directory (FR-025)
- Visualization MUST be part of the main `generate.sh` pipeline, not manual (FR-026)
- User wants actual images (not ASCII art)

**Spec Changes Made**:
- Added FR-023: Visual documentation (SVG/PNG/images) integrated into pipeline
- Added FR-024: Automatic visualization generation (flexible tooling - may use keymap-drawer, custom generator, or other tools)
- Added FR-025: Diagrams placed in docs/keymaps/ directory
- Added FR-026: Visualization is part of main pipeline (not manual)
- Removed "Visual keymap generation" from Out of Scope

**Visualization Options**:
1. **Use existing keymap-drawer** (via generate_keymap_diagram.sh) - if it works with generated keymaps
2. **Custom Python visualization generator** - directly from YAML using matplotlib/Pillow/SVG libraries
3. **Other suitable tools** - flexibility to choose best option during implementation

**Integration Strategy** (example using existing script):
```python
# In scripts/generate.py main()
for board in boards:
    # 1. Generate keymap files
    generate_keymap(board)

    # 2. Generate visualization (flexible approach TBD during implementation)
    # Option A: Call existing script if compatible
    # Option B: Custom Python viz generator from YAML
    generate_visualization(board, layers)
```

### Summary
- **Passing**: 5/5 principles pass ✅
- **Enhanced**: Principles II, III, IV, V are strengthened by this feature
- **Blocking Issues**: None

## Post-Design Constitution Re-check

**Re-evaluated after Phase 1 design (research, data model, contracts)**

### Principle I: Upstream Modularity
**Status**: ✅ PASS (CONFIRMED)

**Post-Design Analysis**: The detailed file structure confirms complete isolation:
- Generator scripts in `scripts/` (Python modules)
- Generated keymaps in `qmk/keymaps/<board>_dario/`
- Unified configs in `config/` (new directory, zero upstream conflict)
- All personal code remains out of `quantum/`, `keyboards/*/` base directories

**No changes needed**.

### Principle II: Core 36-Key Layout Consistency
**Status**: ✅ PASS (STRENGTHENED)

**Post-Design Analysis**: Data model enforces consistency:
- `Layer.core` validation requires exactly 36 keys (data-model.md)
- `LayerCompiler` ensures core is applied before extensions
- Generator contracts guarantee identical translation across all boards
- Impossible to have inconsistent core layouts (compile-time guarantee)

**Architecture improvement**: Better than manual approach (was error-prone, now impossible to violate).

### Principle III: Extension Modularity for Larger Keyboards
**Status**: ✅ PASS (ENHANCED WITH CLEAR BOUNDARIES)

**Post-Design Analysis**: Extension system is well-defined:
- `LayerExtension` dataclass with validation (data-model.md)
- Per-layer extension definitions (not global)
- Board references extensions via `boards.yaml` (clear ownership)
- Gaming layers handled via `extra_layers` in board config

**Architecture improvement**: Code generation eliminates need for wrapper macros - generator brute-forces complete keymaps for each board size, automatically padding from 36-key core to target board size (36, 42, 58 keys).

### Principle IV: Keyboard Inventory Transparency
**Status**: ✅ PASS (MACHINE-READABLE NOW)

**Post-Design Analysis**: `config/boards.yaml` provides:
- Complete board inventory in structured format
- Firmware type, features, status per board
- Machine-parseable for automation
- Auto-generate `KEYBOARDS.md` confirmed in quickstart.md

**Architecture improvement**: Inventory is now part of the build system, not just documentation.

**Answer to open question**: YES, auto-generate `KEYBOARDS.md` from `boards.yaml` (quickstart Step 5 defines this).

### Principle V: Visual Keymap Documentation
**Status**: ✅ PASS (DESIGN COMPLETE)

**Post-Design Analysis**: Visualization strategy confirmed with flexible tooling:
- Visual diagram generation (SVG/PNG images) in `ICodeGenerator.generate_visualization()` contract
- Placed in `docs/keymaps/` directory (FR-025)
- Integrated into main generation pipeline (FR-026)
- Automation confirmed: Part of `scripts/generate.py` pipeline
- Flexible implementation: May use keymap-drawer, custom Python generator, or other suitable tools

**Implementation plan**: Phase 1 includes visualization (quickstart.md).

**Spec updated**: Visual keymap generation now IN SCOPE (FR-023, FR-024, FR-025, FR-026). Removed from "Out of Scope" section.

### Final Assessment

**All Principles**: ✅ PASS

**Enhancements Delivered**:
- Principle II: Architectural guarantee of consistency (was manual, now automated)
- Principle III: Structured extension system (was ad-hoc, now typed)
- Principle IV: Machine-readable inventory (was documentation-only, now operational)
- Principle V: Automated visualization (was manual, will be automated)

**Concerns Resolved**:
- Principle V automation strategy confirmed in quickstart.md
- `KEYBOARDS.md` auto-generation confirmed (Phase 5 tooling)

**Design Approval**: Constitution check PASSED. No blocking issues for implementation.

```

**Structure Decision**:
- **Monorepo approach** with unified configuration in `config/` directory
- **Generated vs Manual files clearly separated**: `qmk/keymaps/` and `zmk/keymaps/` are fully generated, `qmk/config/` and `zmk/config/` are user-editable firmware-specific settings
- **Single source of truth**: `config/keymap.yaml` defines all layers and extensions
- **Board inventory centralized**: `config/boards.yaml` maps keyboards to extensions
- **Generator scripts in Python**: Better YAML parsing, string templating, and testing than Bash
- **Existing QMK userspace**: `users/dario/` directory becomes obsolete (replaced by generator templates)

## Build Process

### QMK Build Process

**Local Builds**:
1. Run `python3 scripts/generate.py` to generate all QMK keymaps
2. Run `qmk userspace-compile` to build all configured boards
3. Or use `./build_all.sh` which runs both steps automatically

**CI/CD** (GitHub Actions):
- Uses existing QMK build action
- Generates keymaps first, then compiles firmware
- Uploads `.hex`/`.bin`/`.uf2` files as artifacts

### ZMK Build Process

**Local Builds** (Docker-based):
1. Run `python3 scripts/generate.py` to generate all ZMK keymaps
2. Run `zmk/build_zmk.sh` to build ZMK firmware using Docker
3. Docker process:
   - Pulls `zmkfirmware/zmk-build-arm:stable` image (or uses cached version)
   - Mounts local `~/git/zmk` repository as `/workspaces/zmk`
   - Mounts `qmk_userspace/zmk/config/` as ZMK config directory
   - Runs `west build` for each board/shield in `zmk/build.yaml`
   - Copies `.uf2` files to `firmware/` directory
   - Cleans up container

**Build Configuration**:
- `zmk/build.yaml`: Lists board/shield combinations to build
  ```yaml
  include:
    - board: nice_nano_v2
      shield: corne_left
    - board: nice_nano_v2
      shield: corne_right
  ```
- `zmk/config/west.yml`: Points to ZMK repository for west builds
- `zmk/config/boards/<board>.conf`: Board-specific ZMK settings

**CI/CD** (GitHub Actions):
- Uses ZMK's official reusable workflow: `zmkfirmware/zmk/.github/workflows/build-user-config.yml@main`
- Automatically reads `zmk/build.yaml` for build targets
- Generates keymaps first, then builds firmware
- Uploads `.uf2` files as artifacts

**Split Keyboard Handling**:
- For split keyboards (Corne, Lily58, etc.), both left and right halves are built separately
- Each half is a separate entry in `zmk/build.yaml`
- Firmware files are named: `<keyboard>_left.uf2` and `<keyboard>_right.uf2`
