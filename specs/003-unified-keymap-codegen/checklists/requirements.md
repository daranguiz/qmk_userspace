# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified QMK/ZMK Keymap Configuration with Code Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: The specification focuses on user needs (eliminating manual duplication, supporting multiple keyboards) without prescribing implementation technologies. All mandatory sections are present.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable (time-based metrics, compilation success rate, reduction percentages) and technology-agnostic. Edge cases thoroughly identified. Assumptions and scope boundaries clearly documented.

**Feature Readiness**: User stories are prioritized (P1/P2/P3) with clear acceptance scenarios. Each story is independently testable and provides value. Success criteria align with functional requirements.

### Updates:

**2025-11-13 (1st update)**: Updated User Story 2 to reflect bidirectional firmware-specific feature filtering (superset approach). The unified keymap now supports both QMK-specific and ZMK-specific features, with automatic filtering in both directions rather than just stripping ZMK features from QMK. Updated FR-006, FR-007, SC-004, and edge cases to reflect this broader scope.

**2025-11-13 (2nd update)**: Clarified User Story 3 to emphasize that board-specific layout extensions are defined in the unified configuration layer and compiled down during generation. The QMK/ZMK directories must contain ONLY generated code with no user-editable configuration. Updated FR-009, FR-010, Board Configuration entity description, acceptance scenarios, and edge cases to reflect that all user configuration lives at the unified config level.

No issues found during validation.
